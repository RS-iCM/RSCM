## Overview

RSCM is a modular, Python-based simulation framework that integrates remote sensing data with crop modeling processes. Designed for agricultural monitoring, RSCM enables dynamic simulation of crop growth, biophysical parameters (e.g., LAI, AGDM), and yield prediction under diverse environmental and management conditions. This framework facilitates the incorporation of machine learning algorithms to enhance parameter calibration and improve forecasting accuracy.
